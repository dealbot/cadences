The Dealbot Cadence Library (DCL) is a collection of precisely defined outreach schedules in [CadenceML](../CadenceML) format for salespeople, customer success teams, and others who want to enforce a rigorous contact rhythm.

## Cadences in the library

* **[7x7](7x7.yml)** — the classic original from [SalesLoft](http://salesloft.com)
* **[5x11](5x11.yml)** — slower pace and a social step for bigger-ticket sales perfected by [Faraday](http://faraday.io)'s Scott Pellegrini

*Have you discovered a cadence you'd like to share? See the "Contributing" section below.*

## Tools that use the DCL

* **[Dealbot](../dealbot)**: Open-source sales automation for Pipedrive

*Do you mantain a tool that uses these cadences? Please open a Pull Request to add it to the list!*

## Contributing

We're actively seeking to add well-defined cadences to the DCL. We prefer cadences that are published elsewhere, even simply on a blog.

### To contribute

Add a file for your cadence and submit a Pull Request.

[Faraday](http://www.faraday.io) is a beautiful, map-driven customer outreach and analytics platform. Visualize your customers and explore hundreds of built-in household level attributes. Build audiences of customers, leads, and brand new prospects, then reach them online and off.

Faraday started the [Dealbot](../dealbot) project to share the open-source sales automation system we built on top of Pipedrive. Gathering a variety of useful cadences was an important first step, so we created the DCL.
